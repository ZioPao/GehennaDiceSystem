---------------------------------------

Certainly! Let's break down the pattern "%[([^%]]+)%]:" and explain each component:

    "%[" and "%]": These are literal characters that match the opening and closing square brackets, respectively. The % is an escape character used to match the literal square brackets.

    ([^%]]+): This part is a capture group (...) that captures the text inside the square brackets. Let's break it down further:
        [^%]]: This is a character class [^...] that matches any character that is not a closing bracket (]). The % before the closing bracket is an escape character to match the literal closing bracket.
        +: The + quantifier matches one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern. In this case, it matches one or more characters inside the square brackets.

    ":": This is a literal character that matches the colon symbol : in the input string.
